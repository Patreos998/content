The HTTP {{HTTPHeader("Permissions-Policy")}} header `picture-in-picture` directive controls whether the current document is allowed to play a video in a {{domxref("Picture-in-Picture API", "Picture-in-Picture", "", "nocode")}} mode.

Specifically, where a defined policy blocks use of this feature, {{domxref("HTMLVideoElement.requestPictureInPicture()")}} calls will throw a {{domxref("DOMException")}} of type `SecurityError`.
